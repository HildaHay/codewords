# Code Words
This is a board image generator for the game [Codenames], by Vlaada Chvati.

You can generate images in your browser on the live [github.io] site.

To specify words, add `?words=one,two,three...` to the end of the URL in your address bar on the live site. The generator will always produce 25 cards, regardless of the number of words given.

To mark a word as scored for the red team, replace it with `r` in the address bar. Similarly you can use `b`, `n`, or `a` to represent blue, neutral, or assassin respectively.

Here is a demo board of one possibility for a [completed game].
